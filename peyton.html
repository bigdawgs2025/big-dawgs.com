  <h1>Peyton ‚Äì Dawg of the Month</h1>

  <img src="peyton1.jpg" alt="Peyton on a boat">
  <p>Boat days are better with Peyton at the helm. Catch her navigating tides and turning heads ‚Äî all while repping the stars and stripes.</p>

  <img src="peyton2.jpg" alt="Peyton thumbs up">
  <p>Low maintenance, high vibes. Bonus points for duct tape. She‚Äôs got grit, charm, and a top-tier meme game.</p>

  <img src="peyton3.jpg" alt="Peyton at a party">
  <p>Peyton lights up every room ‚Äî and sometimes the whole sorority wall. Certified GLOW Queen with unmatched party presence.</p>

  <img src="peyton4.jpg" alt="Peyton in ski gear">
  <p>Slope style meets snow ninja. Peyton keeps it chill on the mountain but might ski straight into your heart.</p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 60px;">Suitor Screening Criteria üìã</h2>
<p>
Peyton enjoys long walks on the beach, abstract art she pretends to understand, and creative dates that don‚Äôt involve splitting a check. A Charlotte-based banker with a cat and a mortgage, she is the oldest of four siblings and carries that oldest-child emotional weight like a pro. She doesn‚Äôt *expect* flowers on a first date ‚Äî but would absolutely judge you silently if you don‚Äôt bring them.
</p>

<p>
Now, before you slide into her DMs or drop a LinkedIn connection, here‚Äôs what we gathered from our *very official* interviews with family and friends:
</p>

<ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto 40px;">
  <li><strong>Brother Mason‚Äôs Criteria:</strong> Suitors should ideally be 5'4" so Mason can beat them up. But if you're nice enough, 6'4" is acceptable ‚Äî begrudgingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Sister Campbell‚Äôs Dilemma:</strong> There‚Äôs an ongoing debate: dad bod vs. gym bro. Peyton says jacked. Campbell says squishy is in. We say ‚Äî both should apply. May the biceps (or brunch belly) win.</li>
  <li><strong>Campbell‚Äôs Wish:</strong> He must be emotionally intelligent, masculine, and able to meet all her needs ‚Äî physical, mental, and whatever other chakras are involved.</li>
  <li><strong>Elizabeth‚Äôs Expertise:</strong> Handsome is good. Smart is better. Rich? Ideal.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Finally, for legal reasons, you must be okay with:
</p>
<ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto 40px;">
  <li>Being filmed during all interactions</li>
  <li>Subject to mandatory exit interviews</li>
  <li>Having those interviews critiqued by Peyton's personal Board of Advisors (i.e. friends & family)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Only qualified suitors will be considered. But don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî KPIs are flexible if your love language is charcuterie and commitment.
